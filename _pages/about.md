I'm a Master's student in Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I completed my undergrad from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2024, where I studied Computer and Communication Engineering (with a minor in Computational Math). 

I'm interested in the intersection of systems and data. Recently, I've been exploring network optimization, dynamic graph algorithms, and systems for ML.

I have been an intern at [CiSTUP](https://cistup.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, under the supervision of [Prof. Tarun Rambha](http://civil.iisc.ac.in/~tarunr/). Previously, I interned at IIIT Hyderabad as part of SRISHTI '22, and at the Chennai Mathematical Institute under [Prof. M.K. Srivas](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~mksrivas/). During my undergrad, I've been part of [Project MANAS](https://projectmanas.in/), MIT Manipal's official autonomous vehicles team. 

I also worked as a summer intern at [SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html) in June '23 and Jan-July '24.
