I'm a final year student studying Computer and Communication Engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology, India. 

I am broadly interested in developing computational solutions to mathematical problems, particularly ones in graph theory, combinatorics, and geometry. Currently, I'm exploring network optimization and graph algorithms.

I have been an intern at [CiSTUP](https://cistup.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, under the supervision of [Prof. Tarun Rambha](http://civil.iisc.ac.in/~tarunr/). Previously, I interned at IIIT Hyderabad as part of SRISHTI '22, and at the Chennai Mathematical Institute under [Prof. M.K. Srivas](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~mksrivas/). During my undergrad, I worked on Eve (a self-driving car) and Seraphim (a UAV) as part of [Project MANAS](https://projectmanas.in/), MIT Manipal's official robotics team. 

I also worked as a summer intern at [SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html) in June '23.
